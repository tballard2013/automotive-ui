Problems I'm grappling with...

Define and scope this project better so I can start solving the problem.

## Problem 1: Lots of freeform writing and revision

Its going to take a lot of writing and revision. What's the best system for managing this as it scales up?
HTML, JavaScript, CSS have been the toolset of my professional trade... are they appropriate here?
They seem cumbersome as I fiddle with purely freeform writing.
What about markdown?

Pros and cons of markdown?

Does it work natively in the browser? (I'd prefer the tools be ubiquitous and not require users to get additional tools in order to wade in.)

## Problem 2: Determine and specify the project's METHOD

As an engineer, I consider the importance of nailing down as many of the aspects of the project as possible in order to (1) gain better understanding of the size and complexity of the problem space (and get a better sense of whether my own skillset is sufficient to proceed, and at what point I need to enlist subject matter experts to help with #2.  

(2) Improve the chances of a successful outcome. As I'm nailing down the specifics it'll become more clear whether I'm solving a problem that's already been solved. I'd rather not reinvent the wheel (as the adage goes) and the sooner I can figure out if I'm working on a wheel, the less I'll have to throw away, less time I'll have wasted, and less inertia I'll have to overcome to STOP working on the wheel.

(3) Control the costs associated with the effort... mostly time and opportunity cost of losing that time I could be spending on other areas of interest.

Since I'm not a subject matter expert as I start this project, I need to adopt a method for laying out what I'm working on and then shoring up the areas where I need further development. So... I need to define the method I'm taking in scoping the project.

## Problem 3: Capturing the journey. 

Scrum and Kanban are helpful tools in breaking up scopes of work into tasks and stories that can be tackled over time by one or more people working on a project. BUT, I'm not sure how well the story of those developments comes together later to weave a tale that can be handed off to another team in order to allow the passing of earned knowledge/experience without requiring that new team to go through exactly the same exercise like running on a treadmill. 

In agile, sprints ostensibly organize scrum or kanban tasks over time, so perhaps I need to impose the discipline of these tools... but, I don't want to inadvertantly become trapped in a propriatary toolset with a partner I need to pay time or money to in order to maintain access to the tools. 

(For example, working with scrumworks, jira, bamboo, and other tools that help in a professional setting, also come with seen and unseen costs... my personal opinion at this time is to try to avoid becoming beholden to a partner that can pull out the proverbial rug intentionally or unintentionally.)
