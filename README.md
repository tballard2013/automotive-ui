exploring the creation of a "gauge cluster" for next gen automobiles


## Objective

This is simply a personal curiosity for now. I've been enamored with cars since childhood and then game programming and web development as a young adult. This is just exploring whether I can combine the two in any kind of meaningfully satisfying way and to see what problems and challenges come up in the process. (See the fantasy mission statement for what I'd love to see this become...if it goes anywhere but into the recycle bin...)

### Fantasy Mission Statement
Provide an open (non-proprietary) user-interface for next generation automobiles that's loved by the end-user (for its speed, simplicity, configurability, and general utility) and sought-out and embraced by OEM and after-market providers (for quick, reliable adoption, and easy maintenance and extendability) 

...**dreaming on**.


If this is an area that you find interesting as well, I'd love your feedback. 

Best wishes!

### TODOS/Action Items: 

...thinking out loud...

* [ ] research:
    * [ ] what work has already been done in this space. 
    * [ ] pros/cons/nits.

* [x] init
    * [x] repo
    * [x] host
    * [x] project workspace
    * [x] project board

* [ ] layout
    * [ ] web-based ui? (pros/cons) -
        * is this performant
        * can this be done without becoming bloated (frameworks vs vanilla/standards-based)
            * if this were to scale up, would the chosen approach appeal to developers and be price-competitive to build/maintain
                * costs of annual proprietary conferences vs. standards driven technologies like HTML, CSS, JS
                * best bang-for-buck for project and individual contributors

    * [ ] responsive? (pros/cons)
        * can the same code drive an in-vehicle display/user-input device as well as phones, tablets, computers, whats-next-devices
            * cost/benefits? (wide vs narrow focus on specs... is it more economical to target a very specific application, like a single display type?)

* [ ] accessibility factors
    * [ ] visually impaired folks
        * color blindness
        * sight issues reducing readability
        * cognitive overhead
            * balance needs/wants so we're not impeding driver cognition
        * user preferences
    * [ ] audio
        * cues
        * verbal controls
        * volume
        * user preferences
