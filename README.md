exploring the creation of a "gauge cluster" for next gen automobiles


Mission

This is simply a personal curiosity as of writing. I've been enamored with cars since childhood and then game programming and web development as a young adult. This is just exploring whether I can combine the two in any kind of meaningfully satisfying way and to see what problems and challenges come up in the process.

If this is an area that you find interesting as well, I'd love your feedback. 

Best wishes!





TODOS: 

...thinking out loud...

___ research:
    ___ what work has already been done in this space.

___ init
    ___ repo
    ___ host
    ___ project workspace
    ___ project board

___ layout
    ___ web-based ui? (pros/cons) -
        -is this performant
        -can this be done without becoming bloated (frameworks vs vanilla/standards-based)
            -if this were to scale up, would the chosen approach appeal to developers and be price-competitive to build/maintain
                -costs of annual proprietary conferences vs. standards driven technologies like HTML, CSS, JS
                    -best bang-for-buck for project and individual contributors

    ___ responsive? (pros/cons)
        -can the same code drive an in-vehicle display/user-input device as well as phones, tablets, computers, whats-next-devices
            -cost/benefits? (wide vs narrow focus on specs... is it more economical to target a very specific application, like a single display type?)

___ accessibility factors
    ___ visually impaired folks
        -color blindness
        -sight issues reducing readability
        -cognitive overhead
